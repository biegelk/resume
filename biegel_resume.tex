\begin{rSection}{Work Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Graduate Researcher}{September 2018 -- present}{Argonne National Laboratory}{Lemont, IL, USA}
  \item \textbf{Creator and lead developer} for the Agent-Based Capacity Expansion (ABCE) code
    \begin{itemize}
      \setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}
      \item \textbf{Experience highlights: Python, Julia, SQLite databases, optimization, economic modeling}
      \item ABCE simulates generation asset investment decisions of independent utility companies competing in a wholesale electricity market
      \item Implemented flexible capabilities for carbon taxes, ITCs, and multiple types of PTC
      \item Developed market representations for Texas and Illinois (PJM/MISO) grid regions by extracting historical market data on generation mix and timeseries data for demand, wind, solar, and ancillary services
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Market and policy analyst} for the U.S. Department of Energy's Civil Nuclear Credit (CNC) Program
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}
    \item \textbf{Experience highlights: Excel modeling, economic modeling, ad-hoc analysis/reporting, domain research/literature review, executive stakeholder communication}
    \item CNC program goal: provide financial support to nuclear reactors in the U.S. which are struggling to compete in wholesale markets, based on assessment of each applicant unit's financial shortfall
    \item Developed an Excel operating profit model for all U.S. commercial nuclear reactor units, to analyze trends in generator profitability and characterize the impacts of state and federal subsidy programs
    \item Researched and modeled impacts of state and federal nuclear subsidy programs (multiple types of PTCs, PPAs): structure, compensation levels, terms and conditions
    \item Wrote analysis summary report for CNC leadership
    \item Ongoing ad-hoc analyses, scenario studies, and model expansions in response to U.S. federal government requests
    \item Note: work described in this section is based solely on publicly-available information
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Technoeconomic analyst} for the 2022 Department of Energy coal-to-nuclear transitions report and the 2023 extension study (in progress)
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}
    \item \textbf{Experience highlights: economic modeling, domain research/literature review}
    \item Developed conceptual and quantitative models of technoeconomic factors affecting feasibility of coal-to-nuclear conversion projects
    \item Developed models of activities and costs required to decommission and remediate coal plant sites
    \item Using ABCE to model decision drivers and utility firms' preferences among possible types of coal-to-nuclear conversion projects
  \end{itemize}

\begin{rSubsection}{Energy Consulting Manager}{July 2015 -- July 2017}{PowerAdvocate, Inc.}{Boston, MA, USA}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{-3pt}
  \item Economic modeling and regulatory rate-case support for utility client capital investment planning process
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Experience highlights: Excel modeling, ad-hoc analysis/reporting, project cost modeling, executive/public stakeholder communication}
    \item Developed valuation model of client firm and transmission infrastructure capital investment plan (\$10B over 10 years), to model client's proposed transition from one prime construction contractor to a better-performing competitor, incorporating scenarios and sensitivity studies
    \item Researched regulatory and rate-setting processes in client's jurisdiction in order to estimate impacts of high construction cost unpredictability on regulatory burden
    \item Authored evidentiary documents in defense of this and other work performed for the same client, which led to the ratemaking authority ruling in favor of the client's improved capital investment plan
    \item Regularly presented results to, solicited feedback from, and cultivated buy-in with client executive-level points of contact
  \end{itemize}
  \item Researched migration patterns and macroeconomic availability drivers for skilled craft laborers across Canada, for annual study of utility craft labor costs
\end{rSubsection}
