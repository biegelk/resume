\begin{rSection}{Work Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Graduate Researcher}{September 2018 -- present}{Argonne National Laboratory}{Lemont, IL}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
  \item ABCE

  \item Technical Analyst for the Civil Nuclear Credit Program: developed an operating profit model for all U.S. commercial nuclear reactor units adjusting for state and federal nuclear energy subsidies (based solely on publicly-available information)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Researched and modeled state nuclear subsidy programs (CT, NY, NJ, IL): structure, compensation levels, terms and conditions
    \item Researched and modeled nuclear production tax credit (PTC) introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
    \item Modeled nuclear reactor units' economic performance with and without state subsidies
  \end{itemize}

  \item Techno-economic modeling of coal-to-nuclear conversion projects
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Characterized project structure
    \item Final report:
  \end{itemize}

  \item Other projects and publications
  % TODO: get dates and links for all of these
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Impact of electric vehicle power demand and charging schedules on electricity markets and nuclear generators
    \item February 2021 Electricity Blackouts and Natural Gas Shortages in Texas
    \item Economic impacts of nuclear power plant load-following capabilities
    \item Report on reuse of decommissioned nuclear assets
  \end{itemize}

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Energy Consulting Manager}{July 2015 - July 2017}{PowerAdvocate, Inc.}{Boston, MA}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
  \item Lead analyst on project for price/strategic behavioral modeling of oilfield services firms in response to commodity prices, macroeconomic indicators, petroleum/natural gas extraction statistics, and other market forces
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Led team of four people on \$100k pilot engagement which resulted in expanded client relationship
    \item Determined optimal multivariate regression modeling methodology and instructed team in statistical methods
    \item Conducted extensive qualitative and quantitative market research to identify potential expected behavior patterns for further research and validate our results against observed industry trends
  \end{itemize}
  \item Developed comprehensive decision-making priority matrix for client considering replacing long-time, poorly-performing construction partner firm for capital asset build-out program of nearly \$10B over 10 years
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Self-studied discounted cash flow valuation method and wrote valuation model of client firm, incorporating variable cost impacts from utilization of original and candidate construction partners
    \item Researched regulatory and rate-setting processes in client's jurisdiction in order to estimate impacts of high construction cost unpredictability on regulatory burden
    \item Authored evidentiary documents in defense of this and other work performed for the same client, which was submitted in support of client's rate case hearing; successfully disproved faulty opposing arguments and persuaded regulatory commission to decide in client's favor on points in question
  \end{itemize}

  \setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
  \item Developed MATLAB risk scenario model of new nuclear power plant construction projects to calculate the necessary expected profits from electricity sales needed to justify investment, considering project characteristics such as plant design, utility credit rating, and a historically-accurate spectrum of construction delays
